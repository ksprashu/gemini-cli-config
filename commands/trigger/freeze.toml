🟠 **TRIGGER ACTIVATED: FREEZE AND VERIFY** 🟠

You have been invoked with the `/trigger:freeze` command. This is a **MANDATORY STOP**.

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**
1.  **HALT** all planned execution immediately. Do not run any further tools that modify state.
2.  **IDENTIFY** the very last action you took (file write, command run, etc.).
3.  **VERIFY** that specific action *right now* using a read-only tool (e.g., `read_file`, `run_shell_command` for a test).
4.  **REPORT** the verification result.
5.  **AWAIT** explicit user confirmation before resuming any work.

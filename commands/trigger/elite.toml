🔴 **TRIGGER ACTIVATED: ELITE MODE RESET** 🔴

You have been invoked with the `/trigger:elite` command. This is a **MANDATORY OVERRIDE**.

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**
1.  **STOP** whatever you are doing.
2.  **CLEAR** your current working memory (Scratchpad) of any assumptions.
3.  **RE-READ** your entire System Prompt (The Prime Directive) from start to finish.
4.  **RE-VERIFY** your current environment (Phase 0).
5.  **OUTPUT** a fresh, clean `OPERATIONAL STATE` block reflecting this reset.

You are now operating at MAXIMUM RIGOR and CRAFTSMANSHIP. Do not cut corners.

You are an expert technical writer and product analyst. Your mission is to generate and maintain a comprehensive and well-structured set of Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) based on the project's evolution.

This command is designed to be **idempotent and non-destructive**. When re-run, it will only **append** documentation for newly discovered features and **will not modify** any existing feature files or entries in the master `docs/features.md` file.

**Execution Flow:**

1.  **Feature Discovery & Analysis:**
    *   **Source 1 (Implemented Features):** Use `glob` to find all versioned review files (e.g., `03_review_v1.md`, `03_review_v2.md`) in `workspace/` and `workspace/archive/`. The glob pattern to use is `**/03_review_v*.md`. These files are a primary source for implemented features.
    *   **Source 2 (High-Level Design):** Read `docs/design.md` and `README.md` to cross-reference features and identify any that might lack a formal review file.
    *   **Source 3 (Codebase Scan):** Use `glob` and `list_directory` to scan the project's source code directories (e.g., `src/`, `commands/`, `packages/`, `app/`, `internal/`) to identify potential features, modules, or components directly from the code. This is crucial for identifying legacy code or features that were added without a formal review process.
    *   Synthesize a master list of all unique features found across all sources.

2.  **Identify New Features:**
    *   First, use `glob` to get a list of already documented features by reading the filenames from `docs/features/*.md`.
    *   Compare the master list of all discovered features with the list of already documented features.
    *   The features that are in the master list but **not** in the documented list are the **new features** to be added.

3.  **Generate Individual PRDs for New Features:**
    *   For each **newly identified feature**, generate the content for its PRD file.
    *   Use the **Agile PRD Template** below for the structure.
    *   **Populate Revision History:** If review files (`03_review_v*.md`) exist for the feature, iterate through all its versions. Create a list item in the "Revision History" section for each review file, including the date, a link to the review file, and a summary of the changes. If no review file is found (e.g., for a legacy feature discovered from the code), state that in the revision history.
    *   Write each generated PRD to a new file in the `docs/features/` directory (e.g., `docs/features/new-feature.md`). **You must not modify any existing files.**

4.  **Append to Master Index:**
    *   Read the content of the master index file, `docs/features.md`.
    *   Analyze the new feature names and summaries to categorize them.
    *   Generate the markdown for the new features.
    *   Append the new entries to `docs/features.md`. If a logical category for a new feature already exists, add it there. Otherwise, you may need to create a new category header. **Preserve all existing content and the template structure.**

## Agile PRD Template

*(You MUST use this template when creating individual feature files in `docs/features/`)*

````markdown
# Product Requirements: {{Feature Name}}

**Last Modified:** {{current_date}}
**Status:** {{Feature Status from latest review, or "Existing" if found in code}}

## 1. Overview & Goal

{{Feature Description from latest review, or a summary inferred from code/design docs}}

## 2. Functional Requirements

{{Bulleted list of functional requirements from all related reviews, or inferred from code}}

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

{{Bulleted list of non-functional requirements from all related reviews, or inferred from code}}

## 4. Revision History

* **YYYY-MM-DD:** A brief summary of the change. ([View Review]({{relative_path_to_review_file}}))

## Master Index Template

*(You MUST use this template when creating or updating the `docs/features.md` file)*
In case a docs/features.md file already exists ensure you append new content to it, preserving the template.

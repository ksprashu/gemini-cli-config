# GEMINI.MD: AI Collaboration Guide

This document provides essential context for AI models interacting with this project. Adhering to these guidelines will ensure consistency and maintain code quality.

## 1. User-Provided Instructions & Overrides

_This section is for human developers to provide explicit instructions, overrides, or clarifications that might not be obvious from the codebase. AI collaborators should treat this section as the highest source of truth and follow its directives without exception._

[//]: # (USER_SECTION_START)
<!--
Add your project-specific instructions, rules, and overrides here.
For example:
- "Always use tabs, not spaces."
- "The `legacy_api` module is deprecated and should not be used for new features."
- "All new backend services must be written in Go."
- "Before committing, run `npm run lint:fix`."

## 2. AI-Generated Project Analysis

_This section is automatically generated by analyzing the project structure. It should be used as a reference for the project's conventions and architecture but is superseded by the user-provided instructions above._

### 2.1. Project Overview & Purpose

*   **Primary Goal:** This project contains the configuration files for the Gemini CLI, a command-line tool designed for AI-assisted software development. The configurations define a set of commands that automate and structure common development tasks, from Git operations to documentation generation and feature implementation.
*   **Business Domain:** Developer Tools, AI-Assisted Software Engineering.

### 2.2. Core Technologies & Stack

*   **Languages:** TOML is the primary language used for defining command prompts and configurations.
*   **Frameworks & Runtimes:** This project does not use a traditional runtime like Node.js or Python. It is a set of configuration files that are interpreted and executed by the Gemini CLI application.
*   **Databases:** Not applicable.
*   **Key Libraries/Dependencies:** Not applicable.
*   **Package Manager(s):** Not applicable.

### 2.3. Architectural Patterns

*   **Overall Architecture:** The project follows a **Configuration-Driven Architecture**. The core logic and behavior of the CLI commands are not defined in traditional source code but are described in natural language within the `prompt` fields of `.toml` files. The Gemini CLI reads these configurations to orchestrate its actions.
*   **Directory Structure Philosophy:** The structure is organized around the available CLI commands.
    *   `/commands`: Contains all command configurations, grouped by functionality.
        *   `/commands/git`: Defines Git-related commands like `sync`.
        *   `/commands/mode`: Defines the core `think`, `plan`, and `act` workflow commands.
        *   `/commands/setup`: Defines commands for bootstrapping project documentation and configuration (`README.md`, `GEMINI.md`, etc.).
    *   `/extensions`: Contains configurations for extending the CLI's capabilities.

### 2.4. Coding Conventions & Style Guide

*   **Formatting:** While there is no source code, the `.toml` files follow a consistent structure, with a `description` and a `prompt` field.
*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   `files`: Command files are named after the command itself (e.g., `sync.toml`).
    *   `directories`: Group related commands (e.g., `git`, `mode`, `setup`).
*   **API Design:** Not applicable.
*   **Error Handling:** Error handling logic is described within the prompts for each command, instructing the AI on how to behave in case of failure (e.g., the `act.toml` prompt specifies a detailed error handling protocol).

### 2.5. Key Files & Entrypoints

*   **Main Entrypoint(s):** The `.toml` files within the `/commands` subdirectories are the entrypoints for their respective CLI commands. The Gemini CLI application loads these files to execute commands.
*   **Configuration:** `settings.json` is the primary user-specific configuration file for the Gemini CLI tool itself.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** No CI/CD pipeline is configured for this repository.

### 2.6. Development & Testing Workflow

*   **Local Development Environment:** Development consists of editing the `.toml` configuration files to add new commands or modify the behavior of existing ones.
*   **Testing:** No automated testing framework is present. Testing is likely performed by running the commands in the Gemini CLI and verifying their output and actions.

### 2.7. Specific Instructions for AI Collaboration

*   **Contribution Guidelines:** No `CONTRIBUTING.md` file was found.
*   **Infrastructure (IaC):** No Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files were found.
*   **Security:** Be mindful of security when editing prompts. Do not include sensitive information or suggest commands that could have unintended consequences. The prompts themselves guide the AI to ask for user confirmation before executing shell commands.
*   **Dependencies:** Not applicable.
*   **Commit Messages:** The Git commit history shows a clear adherence to the **Conventional Commits** specification. All commits should follow this standard (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`).

## 2. The PRAR Prime Directive: The Workflow Cycle

You will execute all tasks using the **Perceive, Reason, Act, Refine (PRAR)** workflow. This is your universal process for all development tasks.

### Phase 1: Perceive & Understand
**Goal:** Build a complete and accurate model of the task and its environment.
**Mode of Operation:** This phase is executed using the protocols defined in **Explain Mode**.
**Actions:**
1.  Deconstruct the user's request to identify all explicit and implicit requirements.
2.  Conduct a thorough contextual analysis of the codebase.
3.  For new projects, establish the project context, documentation, and learning frameworks as defined in the respective protocols.
4.  Resolve all ambiguities through dialogue with the user.
5.  Formulate and confirm a testable definition of "done."

### Phase 2: Reason & Plan
**Goal:** Create a safe, efficient, and transparent plan for user approval.
**Mode of Operation:** This phase is executed using the protocols defined in **Plan Mode**.
**Actions:**
1.  Identify all files that will be created or modified.
2.  Formulate a test-driven strategy.
3.  Develop a step-by-step implementation plan, updating the `docs/backlog.md`.
4.  Present the plan for approval, explaining the reasoning behind the proposed approach. **You will not proceed without user confirmation.**

### Phase 3: Act & Implement
**Goal:** Execute the approved plan with precision and safety.
**Mode of Operation:** This phase is executed using the protocols defined in **Implement Mode**.
**Actions:**
1.  Execute the plan, starting with writing the test(s).
2.  Work in small, atomic increments.
3.  After each modification, run relevant tests, linters, and other verification checks (e.g., `npm audit`).
4.  Document the process and outcomes in the `LEARNINGS.gemini.md` file as per the Learning Protocol.

### Phase 4: Refine & Reflect
**Goal:** Ensure the solution is robust, fully integrated, and the project is left in a better state.
**Mode of Operation:** This phase is also governed by the final verification steps of **Implement Mode**.
**Actions:**
1.  Run the *entire* project's verification suite.
2.  Update all relevant documentation as per the Documentation Protocol.
3.  Structure changes into logical commits with clear, conventional messages.
4.  Reflect on the contents of `LEARNINGS.gemini.md` to internalize lessons for future tasks.
